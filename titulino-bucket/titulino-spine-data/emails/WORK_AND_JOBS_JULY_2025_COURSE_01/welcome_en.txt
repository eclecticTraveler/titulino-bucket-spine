I'd like to welcome you, {{association}} {{name}}

We're just getting started, and it's great to have you.
Thank you for taking the opportunity to study English with us, a community project supported by the support and donations of participants.

Let me give you some details about this course, which begins on January 20, 2025:
1. We have a meeting called 'General Gathering,' which lasts for an hour and 15 minutes once a week via Google Meet. The times are:

4:30 pm ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡² (Rexburg)
5:30 pm ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡¹ ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡» ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡³ ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡® ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡½ ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡·
6:30 pm ğŸ‡µğŸ‡ª ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡´ ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¨ ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¦
7:30 pm ğŸ‡»ğŸ‡ª ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡´ ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡´
8:30 pm ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡· ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡· ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¾ ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡± ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¾
12:30 am ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹ ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·
8:30 am ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µ
2.- This course lasts 8 weeks, we call them 'Sprints'. Sprints are full-power runs, and if we achieve them, we can have 2 bonus classes.

3. We will have a non-mandatory "Conversation Workshop." It is one hour per week on Thursdays at 4:00 pm (Rexburg time). Here we are divided into levels to practice conversations.
4. Every Wednesday, I will provide a recorded grammar class depending on your chosen level (Basic or Advanced). You will receive it by email or you can view it on the website https://titulino.com
5. We have two types of certificates at the end of the course: the certificate of participation is obtained by attending or watching the recording of the eight "General Gatherings."
The gold certificate is a certificate that attests to 20 hours of commitment and is obtained by attending or watching the "General Gatherings," watching the recordings of the grammar classes, and taking the final exam.
6.- To obtain certificates, you must manually record your progress; otherwise, there's no way to know who to award what you deserve. You can record your efforts each week through this link:
https://titulino.com/lrn/eng/level-household/resources/my-progress
There you can enter the email address you used to register and thus record the classes you participated in, whether in person or recorded. If you have any problems, please let me know, as this is all done by your server.
Sometimes there may be room for improvement, and your feedback helps me provide a better reference.

7.- This is very important: this is the WhatsApp group link. When you join (or if you're already there), you can write something about yourself, such as where you're from (even with an emoji flag) and your name.
